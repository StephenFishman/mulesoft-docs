= To Execute Tests in Jenkins

In this procedure, you create a Jenkinsfile in your test directory that includes a magic function call:

`apiTests()`

This function can optionally take an argument, such as the location of the tests.

You upload the contents of your test directory to Jenkins and BAT executes tests when the magic function is called. The Jenkinsfile in the bat.demo repo includes configuration code that identifies the location of a test repository.

. Create a named Jenkinsfile in your test directory at the same level as bat.yaml. For example:
+
image::jenkins-file.png[width=192,height=193]
+
. In Jenkinsfile, call the apiTests groovy function:
+
----
#!groovy

apiTests()
----
+
. Upload the contents of your test directory to Jenkins.
+
Bat executes tests in your test directory on Jenkins. If your bat.raml includes a cron expression, tests run repeatedly as specified.
