= Workflow: Test an API Using API Functional Monitoring

You can test any REST API, such as the Deck of Cards API, which is deployed on a server on the internet. The BAT demo github project, for example, uses the Deck of Cards API. 

For example purposes, this workflow covers everything from creation to testing and test reporting of an oversimplified API. After you create and deploy the API on Anypoint Platform, you create a simple hello world test suite.

. link:/api-function-monitoring/bat-playground-task[Run tests in the BAT Playground] to experiment with functions for testing your API.
. Schedule a test to run automatically on Anypoint Platform.
. Set up a report on the scheduled test.
